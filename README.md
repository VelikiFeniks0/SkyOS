# SkyOS
Introducing SkyOS, a fake OS made in python and tkinter


Use Help() command in SkyOS
when you see bootup screen and if you see DO YOU WANT TO INSTALL SKYOS (Y/N): just press y or n

SkyOS may have some bugs and it may be slow.

SkyOS has a fake file system too!
you can create and read fake files!

Actually this is not a fake OS this is just a simulation.

I made it for fun.

to find a source code in SkyOS you need to be in root directory
